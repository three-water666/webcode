# webcode Built-in Tools

This document only covers tools provided by webcode itself. It does not include third-party MCP servers that users add through `webcodeGateway.servers`.

Runtime sources:

- `internal`: local VS Code tools implemented directly in `gateway-vscode/src/tools/`.
- `client`: virtual tools recognized by `bridge-browser/src/content/main.ts` in the browser.

## 1. Gateway Local Tools

These tools are implemented directly in `gateway-vscode/src/tools/` and injected into the Available Tools list in the initialization prompt. File capabilities no longer start through `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`.

Bare tool names only belong to these local tools. Tools exposed by third-party MCP servers appear in the tool list as `serverId:toolName`.

Local tool `path` arguments consistently use workspace-relative paths with `/` separators. Absolute paths, home paths, and backslashes are rejected.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `read_file` | Reads UTF-8 text files inside the workspace, or read-only built-in Skill virtual files under `.webcode/builtin-skills/...`. Supports `head`, `tail`, `start_line`, `end_line`, and `show_line_numbers` for ranged reads and line numbers. |
| `write_file` | Creates or fully overwrites UTF-8 text files inside the workspace. |
| `edit_file` | Applies exact text replacements or unified diff patches to text files inside the workspace. Use `dryRun` to return a diff preview. |
| `search_files` | Searches files by filename or relative path using ripgrep file listing first, with substring and glob matching that is case-insensitive by default, and respects ignore files by default. |
| `search_code` | Searches workspace text files with ripgrep and returns relative paths, line numbers, and matching lines; pass `match: "regex"` when using regex syntax. |
| `execute_command` | Runs short-lived POSIX/bash commands in the background and returns stdout, stderr, and exitCode. It is intended for builds, tests, git, package managers, and project scripts; pass `path` to choose the command directory. Prefer `read_file`, `search_files`, and `search_code` for reading or searching files. |
| `run_in_terminal` | Runs a command in a real visible VS Code integrated terminal and immediately returns a `session_id`; pass `path` to choose the command directory. Every terminal profile uses the same path format. It is intended for persistent tasks or output that should stay visible to the user. It supports dynamically detected terminal profiles such as `default`, `git-bash`, `pwsh`, and `powershell`. Clearly destructive, privileged, or shell-escape commands are rejected before execution. |
| `terminal_session` | Manages terminal sessions created by `run_in_terminal`: use `action=list` to inspect status, `action=read` to read output, and `action=stop` to stop a session. Session summaries expose workspace-relative `path`. |

## 2. Bootstrap-only Tools

These tools are only used by the VS Code gateway and browser extension when initializing a session. They do not appear in Available Tools, and direct model calls are rejected by the browser extension.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `get_project_rules` | Reads `USER_RULES.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` from the workspace root to assemble the initialization prompt. |
| `get_project_context` | Summarizes the current workspace folder name, Git repository status, current Git branch, two-level project structure, and 5 recent commits for the initialization prompt; the project structure shows at most 100 entries, and generated and VCS folders are shown but not expanded. |
| `list_tools` | Returns the model-available tool list grouped by server. Each tool includes its full schema for the initialization prompt. |
| `list_skills` | Lists local skills discovered in the current workspace and webcode built-in skills for the Available Skills section of the initialization prompt. Each item includes a `skillFilePath` that can be passed directly to `read_file`; local skills use workspace-relative `/`-separated paths, while built-in skills use read-only virtual paths under `.webcode/builtin-skills/...`. |

## 3. Browser Client Virtual Tools

These capabilities do not come from an MCP server. They are recognized by `bridge-browser/src/content/main.ts` on the web page.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `webcode_init` | Initializes virtual tools and remains available for manually pasted initialization prompts and older flows. After the browser captures it, the browser calls bootstrap-only tools and writes the system prompt, tool list, and skill list back into the chat box. `/webcode` and `@webcode` triggers now generate the same initialization result directly. The actual name comes from `PROTOCOL.initToolName` in `shared/src/index.ts`. |

## 4. Outside This Document

- Third-party MCP servers mounted through `webcodeGateway.servers`.
- Git, database, browser automation, remote API, or other tools provided by third-party MCP servers. Call them as `serverId:toolName`, for example `github:search_repositories`.
- VS Code command palette commands, status bar actions, and browser extension UI actions.

The current runtime tool list available to the model is determined by Available Tools in the initialization prompt.
